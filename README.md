# simple-stuff

repo for simple code
all of the scripts are python, so to run them you need to have python. (MD컴에 파이썬 설치해뒀으니 거기서 써도 될거에요)

* archive-reader: transforms a slack archive dump to a readable form. If you look at a dump, you will soon notice that it is hard to read (and not unicode-friendly.) For detailed instructions, read the code comments. No dependencies.
* GPhimnay: 매크로임. 클릭 후 타자를 쳐줌. need to install pywinauto (dunno the mac counterpart), oh and probably better version in MD컴, will update when possible
